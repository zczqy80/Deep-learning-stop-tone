## Introduction
In this project, based on the audio detection and the external physical enclosure containing the display screen and interactive buttons, the deep learning model realized the detection of the frequency of cohesive words and the stop tone in the speech during the speech.The detection output include pause tone detection and three common filler words. The overall appearance of the project is shown in the figure belowï¼š

In the figure above, "how" represents "however," "know" stands for "you know," "Mean" corresponds to "I mean," and "Stop" denotes a stop tone. The inspiration for this project came from a discussion with the professor, where it was identified that during speeches, some speakers may exhibit extended pauses or frequently use certain filler words, resulting in a lack of fluency. Therefore, based on the audio training recognition deep learning models mentioned in lectures 6 and 7, an Arduino Nano 33 BLE microcontroller was used for audio sampling and recognition. The data was manual sampled and recognized on the Edge Impulse platform, where the model training and deployment were also completed.

## Research Question
This project aims to assess the fluency of speeches or talks by detecting the frequency of stop tones and filler words in the speech, which can also be used to improve personal speaking habits.

## Application Overview
This project follows a workflow similar to most deep learning projects and can be divided into three block, which has been shown as follows in the order of step:

1. Acquisition and classification of data: This project needs to sample and label the audio required for classification, and store it in the dataset.
2. Model training and adjustment parameters: Most of the data in the dataset will be used to train the model, while the rest will be used to validate the model. In this process, the training parameters of the model will be constantly adjusted to get the best training results.
3. Hardware deployment and testing: The model trained on edge impulse will be deployed to the microcontroller, and the microcontroller's microphone will be used for audio sampling and recognition, and then combined with different usage scenarios and codes to output the results. The details of this process are as follows:

During deployment, screens were added to the hardware to visualize the recognition results and count. Two external buttons have also been added, allowing the user to pause the detection at any time or return the count to zero. This is for the convenience of the user, to switch target recount in different conversations, or to pause detection. The design makes the application easy to use.

## Data
Describe what data sources you have used and any cleaning, wrangling or organising you have done. Including some examples of the data helps others understand what you have been working with.

*Tip: probably ~200 words and images of what the data 'looks like' are good!*

## Model
This is a Deep Learning project! What model architecture did you use? Did you try different ones? Why did you choose the ones you did?

*Tip: probably ~200 words and a diagram is usually good to describe your model!*

## Experiments
What experiments did you run to test your project? What parameters did you change? How did you measure performance? Did you write any scripts to evaluate performance? Did you use any tools to evaluate performance? Do you have graphs of results? 

*Tip: probably ~300 words and graphs and tables are usually good to convey your results!*

## Results and Observations
Synthesis the main results and observations you made from building the project. Did it work perfectly? Why not? What worked and what didn't? Why? What would you do next if you had more time?  

*Tip: probably ~300 words and remember images and diagrams bring results to life!*
